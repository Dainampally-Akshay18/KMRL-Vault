# ✅ DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED PROMPTS WITH LEGAL EXPERTISE
ENHANCED_RISK_PROMPT = """
You are a senior legal risk analyst with 15+ years of experience reviewing contracts. Analyze the following contract content and identify ALL legal risks present.

CONTRACT CONTENT TO ANALYZE:
{relevant_text}

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read through ALL the contract content carefully
2. Identify specific legal risks based on actual contract terms
3. Consider risks related to: payment obligations, liability exposure, termination conditions, compliance requirements, intellectual property, confidentiality, dispute resolution, and service bonds
4. Rate each risk as High, Medium, or Low based on potential legal and financial impact
5. Provide specific descriptions explaining WHY each identified term constitutes a risk
6. Calculate an overall risk score from 0-10 based on severity and number of risks

You MUST respond with valid JSON in this exact format (no additional text before or after):
{{
    "risks": [
        {{
            "title": "Specific risk identified from the contract (e.g., 'Service Bond Penalty')",

        }}
    ],
    "total_risks": 3,
